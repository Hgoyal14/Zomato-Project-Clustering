        "The goal of this project is to build a complete machine learning system that can use data-driven methods to look at and group restaurants. The main goal of the project is to use machine learning algorithms that don't need any help to group restaurants that are similar based on their ratings, prices, popularity, cuisines, and other traits and customer preferences. This kind of segmentation can help businesses make smart choices about things like who to market to, how much to charge, and how to market.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing to do for the project is to gather and analyze data. This meant loading and looking through several datasets that had information about restaurants and reviews from customers. We did some initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to learn how the data was set up, find missing values, duplicates, and outliers, and use charts and plots to show important connections. This step taught us about the spread of ratings, the cost patterns, the number of reviews, and what people like to eat.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, the dataset was cleaned up and made ready for machine learning. We fixed data formats that weren't consistent, got rid of duplicate entries, and deal with missing values in the right way. We used feature engineering to make useful variables like cost categories, review counts that have been log-transformed, and indicators of value for money. We used one-hot encoding and label encoding to encode categorical variables. We also used feature scaling to make sure that all of the numerical features had the same effect on distance-based clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "We used natural language processing (NLP) techniques because the dataset also had reviews from customers that were written down. Lowercasing, removing punctuation, URLs, numbers, stopwords, tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and TF-IDF vectorization were all steps in the preprocessing of text. These steps turned unstructured review text into numbers that could be used to figure things out.\n",
        "\n",
        "Three distinct unsupervised machine learning models were executed and evaluated. We picked K-Means clustering as our first model because it's easy to use and can get bigger. We used the second model, DBSCAN, to find groups of points based on how close they are to each other and how much noise or outliers they have. The third model used to figure out how restaurants are connected was Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering. We used the Silhouette Score to find out how well the model worked. This score tells you how well the data points are split up and grouped together.\n",
        "\n",
        "We set the hyperparameters for each model by using the Elbow Method for K-Means, epsilon tuning for DBSCAN, and linkage analysis for Agglomerative Clustering. We picked K-Means as the final model because it worked well, was easy to understand, and had a higher silhouette score. By looking at the cluster centroids, we were able to figure out which features were most important for dividing restaurants into groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, joblib was used to save the best model so it could be used again later. The saved model was reloaded and tested on new data to make sure it was correct. The project ends by talking about how putting restaurants together can help businesses, like by making it easier to find customers, plan ahead, and market to them. This project uses machine learning ideas in every step, from getting the data ready to using the model."

Multiple clustering models including K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering were implemented and evaluated using Silhouette Score. K-Means was selected as the final model due to its stability, interpretability, and better clustering performance. The results provide meaningful business insights that can support targeted marketing, customer segmentation, and strategic decision-making. The model is deployment-ready and can be extended further with real-time data and recommendation systems."
